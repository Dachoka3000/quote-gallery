## Description
This is a web app for displaying quotes. It allows users to view quotes, upvote on quotes they like, downvote on quotes they don't like and add their own quotes.

## Technologies used
Typescript
HTML
Bootstrap
CSS

## BDD
Open the link in any web browser. Fill in the form to add your own quote; your quote will be displayed on the webpage after pressing the 'add quote' button. Browse through the collection of quotes. Upvote on the quotes that you find insightful and downvote on the quotes you don't like. Each quote has an initial upvote value and downvote value of zero. These values change when the user upvotes or downvotes on a quote, and the final vote count is displayed on the webpage.
